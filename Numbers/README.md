## 🎯 Challenges in the Numbers Path

Here’s a breakdown of the challenges you’ll encounter in this path:

### 1. **Currency Exchange** 💱
- **Objective**: Help Chandler solve his currency exchange conundrums.
- **Tasks**:
  - Calculate exchanged money.
  - Compute leftover change after an exchange.
  - Determine the total value of bills received.
  - Calculate the number of whole bills.
  - Compute leftover money after receiving bills.
  - Factor in fees and denominations to calculate maximum exchangeable value.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`).
  - Type conversions (`int`, `float`).
  - Exception handling using `raise ValueError`.

### 2. **Collatz Conjecture** 🔢
- **Objective**: Explore the famous Collatz Conjecture and calculate the number of steps it takes for a positive integer to reach 1.
- **Rules**:
  - If the number is even, divide it by 2.
  - If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
  - Repeat until the number reaches 1.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement a function to calculate the number of steps.
  - Handle invalid inputs (zero or negative integers) by raising a `ValueError`.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Loops (`while`).
  - Conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
  - Error handling with exceptions.

### 3. **Grains** 🌾
- **Objective**: Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard based on the doubling pattern.
- **Rules**:
  - Square 1 has 1 grain.
  - Each subsequent square doubles the number of grains from the previous square.
- **Tasks**:
  - Write a function to calculate the number of grains on a specific square.
  - Compute the total number of grains on the entire chessboard.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Exponential growth.
  - Large number handling.
  - Efficient computation strategies.

### 4. **Armstrong Numbers** ⚡
- **Objective**: Determine whether a number is an Armstrong number (narcissistic number).
- **Definition**: A number is an Armstrong number if it is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
  - Example: \( 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153 \)
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement a function to check if a number is an Armstrong number.
  - Handle edge cases (e.g., single-digit numbers).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Digit manipulation.
  - Power calculations.
  - Looping through digits of a number.

### 5. **Square Root** √
- **Objective**: Given a natural radicand, return its square root.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement a function to compute the square root of a number.
  - Consider efficiency and accuracy in your implementation.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Mathematical algorithms for square root calculation (e.g., Newton-Raphson method).
  - Precision handling for floating-point numbers.
