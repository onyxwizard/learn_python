# 🌟 Exercism: Exploring Python's Boolean Logic 🔍

Welcome to the **Booleans Path** in Exercism's Python track! This path is designed to help you master Python's `bool` type, Boolean logic, and truthiness. You'll explore how Booleans work under the hood, learn about type coercion, and practice writing clean, reusable code using Boolean operators (`and`, `or`, `not`). By completing this path, you'll gain a solid foundation in handling logical conditions and making decisions in your programs.



## 📋 Overview

The Booleans Path focuses on exploring the `bool` type in Python, which is a subtype of `int`. There are only two Boolean values: `True` and `False`. These values can be combined using Boolean operators and used in conditional logic to control program flow. Each challenge builds upon your understanding of Booleans, helping you develop practical skills that are essential for any programming task involving logical reasoning.

## 🎯 Challenges in the Booleans Path

Here’s a breakdown of the challenges you’ll encounter in this path:

### 1. **Ghost Gobble Arcade Game** 🕹️
- **Objective**: Set up the rules for the Ghost Gobble arcade game using Boolean logic.
- **Tasks**:
  - Determine whether certain conditions are met based on game states.
  - Use Boolean operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to combine conditions.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Logical expressions with multiple conditions.
  - Short-circuit evaluation to optimize performance.
  - Writing clear and concise Boolean logic.

### 2. **Triangle** 🔺
- **Objective**: Determine if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene based on its side lengths.
- **Rules**:
  - **Equilateral Triangle**: All three sides are equal.
  - **Isosceles Triangle**: At least two sides are equal.
  - **Scalene Triangle**: All sides are different.
- **Tasks**:
  - Validate whether the given side lengths form a valid triangle.
  - Classify the triangle based on its side lengths.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Conditional logic with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
  - Combining Boolean conditions to classify triangles.
  - Handling edge cases (e.g., invalid side lengths).

### 3. **Leap Year** 📅
- **Objective**: Determine whether a given year is a leap year.
- **Rules**:
  - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
  - Unless the year is divisible by 100, in which case it must also be divisible by 400.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement a function to check if a year is a leap year.
  - Handle edge cases (e.g., years divisible by 100 but not by 400).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Modular arithmetic (`%` operator).
  - Combining multiple conditions with Boolean operators.
  - Understanding leap year rules and their exceptions.
