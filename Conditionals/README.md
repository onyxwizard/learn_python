# 🌟 Exercism: Mastering Conditional Logic in Python 🧮

Welcome to the **Conditionals Path** in Exercism's Python track! This path is designed to help you master conditional logic using Python's `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. You'll explore how to make decisions in your code based on different conditions, handle edge cases, and write clean, reusable functions. By completing this path, you'll gain a solid foundation in controlling program flow and solving problems with conditional logic.



## 📋 Overview

In Python, conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) allow you to control the flow of execution and make decisions based on specific conditions. These statements are essential for handling different scenarios in your programs. Each challenge in this path will help you practice writing clear, concise, and efficient conditional logic.

## 🎯 Challenges in the Conditionals Path

Here’s a breakdown of the challenges you’ll encounter in this path:

### 1. **Meltdown Mitigation** 🔥
- **Objective**: Develop a simple control system to avoid a meltdown in a nuclear reactor.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement a function to determine whether the reactor is stable or at risk of a meltdown based on given parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure).
  - Use conditional logic to decide when to trigger alerts or take corrective actions.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Logical expressions combining multiple conditions.
  - Handling edge cases to ensure safety.
  - Writing robust conditional logic for critical systems.

### 2. **Bob** 👨‍🦰
- **Objective**: Simulate conversations with Bob, a lackadaisical teenager who responds in very limited ways.
- **Rules**:
  - If the input is a question (ends with `?`), Bob replies `"Sure."`.
  - If the input is yelled (all uppercase), Bob replies `"Whoa, chill out!"`.
  - If the input is silent or contains only whitespace, Bob replies `"Fine. Be that way!"`.
  - For all other inputs, Bob replies `"Whatever."`.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement the `response(message)` function that takes a string `message` as input and returns Bob's response.
  - Handle edge cases like empty strings, mixed-case inputs, and special characters.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - String manipulation (e.g., checking for uppercase, trimming whitespace).
  - Conditional logic with multiple branches (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
  - Understanding user input variations.

### 3. **Pig Latin** 🐷
- **Objective**: Translate English words into Pig Latin.
- **Rules**:
  - Move the initial consonant cluster to the end of the word and add "ay".
  - If a word starts with a vowel, append "way" to the end.
  - Handle punctuation and capitalization appropriately.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement the `translate_to_pig_latin(word)` function that takes a word as input and returns its Pig Latin translation.
  - Ensure the translation preserves the original word's case and handles edge cases like numbers or non-alphabetic characters.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - String slicing and concatenation.
  - Conditional logic for vowel and consonant detection.
  - Handling special characters and maintaining word formatting.

### 4. **Raindrops** 💧
- **Objective**: Convert a number into its corresponding raindrop sounds: "Pling," "Plang," and "Plong."
- **Rules**:
  - If the number is divisible by 3, append "Pling."
  - If the number is divisible by 5, append "Plang."
  - If the number is divisible by 7, append "Plong."
  - If none of the above conditions are met, return the number itself as a string.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement the `convert_to_raindrop_sounds(number)` function that takes an integer `number` as input and returns the appropriate raindrop sounds.
  - Handle edge cases like zero or negative numbers.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Modular arithmetic (`%` operator).
  - Combining multiple conditions with logical operators (`and`, `or`).
  - Building dynamic strings based on conditions.

### 5. **Matching Brackets** ⚠️
- **Objective**: Ensure that brackets and braces in a string are properly matched and nested.
- **Rules**:
  - Open brackets (`(`, `[`, `{`) must be closed by their corresponding closing brackets (`)`, `]`, `}`).
  - Brackets must be properly nested and balanced.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement the `are_brackets_matched(input_string)` function that takes a string as input and returns `True` if all brackets are matched correctly, and `False` otherwise.
  - Handle edge cases like unbalanced brackets or mismatched pairs.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Stack data structure for tracking opening brackets.
  - Iterating through strings and managing state.
  - Complex conditional logic for bracket matching.
