# 🗣️ Bob's Responses: Understanding Conditional Logic in Python 🧠

Welcome to the **Bob's Responses** challenge! In this exercise, you'll simulate a conversation with Bob, a person with very specific and predictable responses. By completing this challenge, you'll practice conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`), string manipulation, and handling edge cases in Python.



## 📋 Overview

Bob is a simple guy who only replies in five distinct ways, depending on how you communicate with him. Your task is to write a function that determines Bob's response based on the input provided. Here are Bob's rules:

1. **"Sure."**: If you ask him a question (a sentence ending with a question mark `?`).
2. **"Whoa, chill out!"**: If you yell at him (a sentence written in ALL CAPS).
3. **"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"**: If you yell a question at him (a sentence in ALL CAPS that ends with a question mark `?`).
4. **"Fine. Be that way!"**: If you say nothing or provide only whitespace characters.
5. **"Whatever."**: For anything else.

This challenge will help you practice handling different types of input and writing clean, reusable code.

## 🎯 Instructions

Your task is to implement the `response(message)` function, which takes a string `message` as input and returns Bob's response based on the rules above.

### Example Usage:
```python
>>> response("How are you?")
"Sure."

>>> response("WHAT ARE YOU DOING?")
"Whoa, chill out!"

>>> response("WHAT ARE YOU DOING?")
"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"

>>> response("")
"Fine. Be that way!"

>>> response("Let's go for a walk.")
"Whatever."
```



## 🔧 Function Documentation

The `response(message)` function comes with detailed docstrings to explain its purpose, parameters, and return values:

```python
def response(message):
    """Determine Bob's response to a given message.
    :param message: str - the input message from the user.
    :return: str - Bob's response based on the input message.

    This function evaluates the input message and returns one of Bob's five possible responses:
        - "Sure." if the message is a question (ends with '?').
        - "Whoa, chill out!" if the message is in all caps.
        - "Calm down, I know what I'm doing!" if the message is a yelled question (all caps and ends with '?').
        - "Fine. Be that way!" if the message is empty or contains only whitespace.
        - "Whatever." for all other cases.
    """
```

## 📚 Example Usage

Here’s how you can use the completed function in your Python environment:

```python
# Ask Bob a question
>>> response("How are you?")
"Sure."

# Yell at Bob
>>> response("WHAT ARE YOU DOING?")
"Whoa, chill out!"

# Yell a question at Bob
>>> response("WHAT ARE YOU DOING?")
"Calm down, I know what I'm doing!"

# Say nothing to Bob
>>> response("")
"Fine. Be that way!"

# Say something random to Bob
>>> response("Let's go for a walk.")
"Whatever."
```



## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this challenge, you will:
