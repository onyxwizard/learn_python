# 🌧️ Raindrops Challenge 🌧️

Welcome to the **Raindrops Challenge**, a fun and slightly more complex twist on the classic FizzBuzz problem! This exercise is perfect for practicing conditional logic, string manipulation, and understanding divisibility in programming. Let's dive into the details with some added flair ✨!



## 📚 Introduction

The **Raindrops Challenge** is a playful take on converting numbers into "raindrop sounds" based on their divisibility. It’s a great way to sharpen your coding skills while having some fun with strings and math. 🎵🌧️



## 🎯 Instructions

Your task is to write a function that converts a given number into its corresponding raindrop sounds. Here’s how it works:

1. **Divisibility Rules**:
   - If the number is divisible by **3**, add `"Pling"` 🎵 to the result.
   - If the number is divisible by **5**, add `"Plang"` 🔔 to the result.
   - If the number is divisible by **7**, add `"Plong"` 💦 to the result.

2. **Default Case**:
   - If the number is **not divisible** by 3, 5, or 7, simply return the number as a string. 🔢



## 🌟 Examples

Here are some examples to help you understand the problem better:

| Input | Divisible By | Output       |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| `28`  | 7            | `"Plong"`    |
| `30`  | 3, 5         | `"PlingPlang"` |
| `34`  | None         | `"34"`       |



## 💡 How It Works

### Key Concepts:
- Use Python’s **modulo operator (`%`)** to check divisibility. For example:
  ```python
  28 % 7 == 0  # True, because 28 is divisible by 7
  ```
- Build the result string incrementally based on the divisibility conditions.
- If no conditions are met, return the number as a string.


## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Steps to Solve:
1. Initialize an empty string `result`.
2. Check each divisibility condition:
   - If divisible by 3, append `"Pling"`.
   - If divisible by 5, append `"Plang"`.
   - If divisible by 7, append `"Plong"`.
3. If `result` is still empty (no conditions were met), return the number as a string.
4. Otherwise, return the constructed `result`.

### Example Code:
```python
def raindrops(number):
    result = ""
    
    if number % 3 == 0:
        result += "Pling"
    if number % 5 == 0:
        result += "Plang"
    if number % 7 == 0:
        result += "Plong"
    
    return result if result else str(number)
```



## 🧪 Test Cases

Here are some test cases to validate your implementation:

```python
print(raindrops(28))  # Output: "Plong"
print(raindrops(30))  # Output: "PlingPlang"
print(raindrops(34))  # Output: "34"
print(raindrops(0))   # Output: "PlingPlangPlong"
print(raindrops(-15)) # Output: "PlingPlang"
```



## 🤔 Edge Cases

Consider these scenarios:
1. **Zero**: `0` is divisible by every number, so the output should be `"PlingPlangPlong"`. 🌈
2. **Negative Numbers**: Handle negative inputs like `-15`, which should output `"PlingPlang"`. ❄️
3. **Prime Numbers**: A prime number like `11` should return `"11"`. 🔑



## ⚡ Complexity Analysis

1. **Time Complexity**:  
   The function performs a constant number of operations (3 modulo checks).  
   **O(1)**.

2. **Space Complexity**:  
   The space used is proportional to the length of the result string.  
   **O(1)**.



## 📚 Additional Notes

- Python provides multiple ways to calculate remainders, such as `math.fmod()` and `divmod()`. However, the `%` operator is the most straightforward and recommended approach for this exercise. 🧮
