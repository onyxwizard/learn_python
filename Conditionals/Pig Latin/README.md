# 🐷 Pig Latin Translator: Speak in Secret Code! 🎤

Welcome to the **Pig Latin Translator** exercise! In this challenge, you'll create a program that translates English text into Pig Latin—a playful children's language. By completing this task, you'll practice string manipulation, conditional logic, and pattern matching in Python. Let’s get started and give your parents a run for their money on the basketball court! 🏀✨



## 📋 Overview

Pig Latin is a fun transformation of English words based on specific rules. The translation depends on whether a word starts with vowels, consonants, or special patterns like "qu" or "y". Here's how it works:

### Key Concepts:
1. **Vowels**: The letters `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u`.
2. **Consonants**: All other letters in the English alphabet.

### Translation Rules:
1. **Rule 1 (Vowel Start)**:  
   - If a word begins with a vowel (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) or starts with `"xr"` or `"yt"`, add `"ay"` to the end of the word.  
     Examples:  
     - `"apple"` → `"appleay"`  
     - `"xray"` → `"xrayay"`

2. **Rule 2 (Consonant Start)**:  
   - If a word begins with one or more consonants, move those consonants to the end of the word and add `"ay"`.  
     Examples:  
     - `"pig"` → `"igpay"`  
     - `"chair"` → `"airchay"`

3. **Rule 3 (Qu Pattern)**:  
   - If a word contains `"qu"`, move all preceding consonants (if any) and the `"qu"` to the end of the word, then add `"ay"`.  
     Examples:  
     - `"quick"` → `"ickquay"`  
     - `"square"` → `"aresquay"`

4. **Rule 4 (Y Pattern)**:  
   - If a word starts with consonants followed by `"y"`, move the consonants to the end of the word and add `"ay"`.  
     Examples:  
     - `"my"` → `"ymay"`  
     - `"rhythm"` → `"ythmrhay"`



## 🎯 Tasks in the Pig Latin Translator

Your goal is to implement a function `translate_pig_latin(text)` that takes an English word or sentence as input and returns its Pig Latin translation. Follow these steps:

### 1. **Translate Single Words**
Write a function that translates individual words into Pig Latin using the four rules described above.

**Examples:**
```python
>>> translate_pig_latin("apple")
"appleay"

>>> translate_pig_latin("pig")
"igpay"

>>> translate_pig_latin("quick")
"ickquay"

>>> translate_pig_latin("my")
"ymay"
```

### 2. **Handle Sentences**
Extend the function to handle entire sentences by splitting the input into words, translating each word, and reassembling the sentence.

**Example:**
```python
>>> translate_pig_latin("hello world")
"ellohay orldway"
```

### 3. **Preserve Punctuation**
Ensure that punctuation marks (e.g., `.` or `,`) remain at the end of translated words.

**Example:**
```python
>>> translate_pig_latin("hello, world!")
"ellohay, orldway!"
```

### 4. **Edge Cases**
Handle edge cases such as empty strings, words with only consonants, or mixed capitalization.

**Examples:**
```python
>>> translate_pig_latin("")
""  # Empty input remains empty

>>> translate_pig_latin("rhythm")
"ythmrhay"

>>> translate_pig_latin("HELLO")
"ELLOHAY"
```

## 📚 Example Usage

Here’s how you can use the completed function in your Python environment:

```python
# Translate single words
>>> translate_pig_latin("apple")
"appleay"

>>> translate_pig_latin("pig")
"igpay"

>>> translate_pig_latin("quick")
"ickquay"

# Translate full sentences
>>> translate_pig_latin("hello world")
"ellohay orldway"

# Handle punctuation
>>> translate_pig_latin("hello, world!")
"ellohay, orldway!"

# Handle edge cases
>>> translate_pig_latin("")
""
```
